# Uplink-rate-of-ZF-and-MRC-Rx
Iâ€™ve developed a simulation in MATLAB and Python that analyzes the uplink sum rate of massive MIMO systems using MRC and ZF receivers. The code evaluates how varying the number of base station antennas impacts data throughput, highlighting trade-offs between receiver complexity and performance.
